**As per learning any new programming language, do not copy and paste, code out all examples**Â 

#### note: If you do try to use Django, without understanding how it works, you will waste days debugging simple things that are explained in the following tutorials. If you try to learn Django without at least understanding the fundamentals of Python, you will struggle. You will also need to have a basic undertanding of HTML and CSS.

1. Django is a Python framework, if you do not understand Python 3 you will struggle a lot.  
    1. At the minimum learn up to classes  
    2. Read [PEP8](https://pep8.org), the official Python style guide  


2. Read the Mozilla guide to html forms, some newcomers fail to understand web forms, and the official Django tutorial does not give this important topic enough emphasis imho. 
     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms  


3. Django means using a database, and if you do not understand how to build a relational database you will struggle.   
    1. https://wsvincent.com/database-design-tutorial-for-beginners/  
    2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database  

4. Do the official Django tutorial, twice. Yes twice, the first time you will struggle, the second time the key concepts will become more clear  
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/  


5. Mozilla use Django in production Complete the Mozilla Django tutorial, the have a very detailed and helpful tutorial. One of my favorite parts, the project is not a Blog and uses multiple tables 5, reflecting an actual real world project.  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django  
This is doable in 2-3 days, faster if you really push it  

6. Read about HTTP: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP  

7. Mozilla is the best site for all things web
