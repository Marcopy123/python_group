## <a name="Purpose">What is the purpose of the group?</a>
To facilitate the learning of Python and promote the Python Programming Languate. Post should be directly related to Python, be it a question you have, a point of discussion, etc.. We will help programmers of all levels, but please note that we are not here to do your homework. The group can be very helpful provided you show effort to resolve the problem on your own, and follow the guidelines for posting questions. The purpose of the group is not to promote your youtube channel or web blog. 

Yes, we help newcomers but we are not here to hold your hand, be prepared to answer the question ["What have you tried?"](https://mattgemmell.com/what-have-you-tried/) 

## <a name="Python Version">Which version of Python should I install?</a>
Python 3.6. If you are using Mac OS or Linux do not attempt to remove the existing installation of Python. For Mac you can use Homebrew to help manage

## <a name="Install">How do install Python?</a>
Depending upon your operating system Python may already be installed, Mac OS, and most versions of Linux already have Python installed. It is important not to remove. Additional help can be found here, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python - Properly Installing Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)

## <a name="Learn">How long does it take to learn Python? What is the fastest way to learn Python?</a>
Learning is a personal matter. It takes years for most people to master Python, but for the average person within a few weeks of hard work you will learn the many of fundamentals to help you write basic programs. If you have previous programming experience this will of course speed up the learning process. We suggest instead of asking "How fast can I learn Python", stop asking superflous questions and just begin.

## <a name="Package">How do I install package/module?</a>
In the majority of case pip, Python's official package manager is used to install packages. Go to the documentation or repository for the package and follow the installation guidelines. 

It is best practise to install packages inside a virtualenv.
**Notes:** 
1. Some packages have dependencies that must be installed first.
2. If you are using Windows, ensure that your path is set.
3. If you are using PyCharm, I suggest reading their (guide)[https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html].

## <a name="On Topic">What topics can I post?</a>
Posts must be directly related to Python. The closely related topic of coding style is also acceptable.

## <a name="Posting">How do I post a question?</a>
Questions that are written in accordance with the [Guidelines](./Group-Guidelines). Do _not_ select _Create poll_, _Looking for recommendations_ when you write your question. Do _not_ add any attachments. Just write your *specific* question and click "post"

## Can we create a WhatsApp group?
No! Never use WhatsApp with strangers! Such a group on WhatsApp would be used by criminals to attack other users. They would see your phone number and they can lure you to malicious websites.

## <a name="Ideas">I need an idea for a project?</a>
It is not our role to give you ideas. Good ideas are a commodity. We do have a document that will help you will some ideas.

## <a name="Best Modules">What are the best Python modules? What is the best Python module to do _XYZ_?</a>
Some things to consider, check that the module is in active development by visiting the code repository. Review the documentation, if the documentation is poor you may want to consider another package.

## <a name="How can">How can I&nbsp;...&nbsp;?
There are many ways to solve a problem. Try to solve it on your own. Break down the problem and search the web to find ideas.  
Show us what ideas you have already, so we can comment on that. State your goal. Ask **specific questions** that can be answered. Or hire someone to do it for you. Our group is for those who want to learn. Donâ€™t expect us to do your work for you. We are here to help learning, not to do your code.

## <a name="Anyone">Does anyone know about _XYZ_?</a>
We are over 99,000 users. The chances are rather high that someone used it before. So just get to the point and ask your actual question. [Learn how to post questions here](./How-To-Post-Questions).

## <a name="How does">How does _XYZ_ work?</a>
Read the manual, documentation, handbook, developer guide. We are not here to read it for you. If there is no documentation then you probably don't want to use it.
